/**
 * scroll-state — the per-frame bridge between GSAP ScrollTriggers and the
 * (future) R3F canvas.
 *
 * Design (spec §11 "Architecture"): a plain, module-level mutable singleton.
 * ScrollTriggers WRITE fields here inside their `onUpdate` callbacks; Task 4's
 * `useFrame` READS them every render. This deliberately bypasses React so the
 * constellation can follow scroll at 60fps with ZERO React re-renders. Discrete,
 * ~4-per-scroll chapter changes go through the gsap ticker calling `setState` in
 * `ChapterNav` instead (a normal React re-render, since they're infrequent) — this
 * module is only for the continuous, per-frame values.
 *
 * Pure & SSR-safe: no `window`/`document` access at import time, no side effects.
 * Direct mutation is the intended API (e.g. `scrollState.chapterProgress = p`);
 * the tiny reset helper below exists only for teardown/tests.
 */

 * Named constellation formations (spec §6 "Formation" column / §7). scroll-map
